Hello my name is Dale Cooper.

I’m a graduate of Germantown Friends School and Haverford College. Quirky and intellectual, with a profound interest in the mystical, particularly in Tibet and Native American mythology. Much of my work is based on intuition and even dreams. I’m joining to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was based at the Bureau offices in Philadelphia.
